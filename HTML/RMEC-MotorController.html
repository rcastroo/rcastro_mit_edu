                        AutomataKit is a collection of open hardware and software being developed at the Center for Bits and
                        Atoms (dir. Neil Gershenfeld) that provides rapidly reconfigurable sets of building blocks for the
                        assembly of robotic systems and digital fabrication machinery. ATK is part of the CBA’s ongoing effort to
                        share digital fabrication equipment and STEM education across the globe, and will be part of the
                        ecosystem of tools used in a network of more than 1000 Fab Labs.
                        A more detailed description of the project can be found here
                        https://gitlab.cba.mit.edu/jakeread/automatakit

                        One subset of ATK’s goals is to include motor control algorithms that adaptively learn their own tuning
                        parameters during operation, to enable adaptable modular software to operate successfully with
                        varying hardware. Among learning broadly how to design, develop and debug electrical circuits,
                        firmware and hardware in a rapid prototyping context, the development of these algorithms are the main concentration of this project.

                        The design goals coming from Broomba were set as follows:
                        I will be responsible for the development of a modular, networked DC Motor Controller for robotic
                        systems. This will include the development of an h-bridge circuit including current and position sensing
                        hardware, as well as the firmware to control current and position loops.
                        After hand-tuning control parameters for this controller, I will look to develop algorithms that search for
                        the optimal set. Most importantly, I will test this adaptively tuned controller against a wide group of
                        variable hardware.
                        With time to spare, I will develop a personal CNC Machine using AutomataKit’s other networked control
                        components. This is an opportunity for me to learn how to use the digital fabrication tools available to
                        researchers in the CBA.

                        This is my first attempt at a circuit board. It shall hold an H-bridge for
                        motor control, current sensing, and SPI pins for encoder implementation.
                        It is a board that revolves around the DRV8701 (http://www.ti.com/product/DRV8701)
                        gate driver chip. The DRV8701 is capable of driving a varied set of MOSFETS.
                        Chosen here are the AON7410 MOSFETS.
