                        Most of this website is designed from raw HTML, Javascript, and CSS. This website runs off
                        of the MIT Drupal Cloud platform, however, each widget is individually made. I did not have much
                        website development knowledge before starting this, however, I have extensive Java and CSS
                        knowledge, so after some experimenting we have this!<br><br>

                        Because Drupal Cloud is not easy to work with, especially if you are making custom pages and code,
                        I resorted to editing my website on JetBrains' WebStorm and then importing to Drupal Cloud.
                        I love Jetbrains. I made a skeleton mock page on each page on Webstorm in order to mimic the outline
                        that Drupal Cloud puts on the page, allowing seamless transition between local editing and uploading.

                        The home page is designed to give a very brief introduction into who I am. I use personal pictures in my
                        slideshow in order for the reader to understand who I am not only professionally, but also as a person.
                        Additionally, I have a picture on the right which is me as a word cloud of my resume and a letter of recommendation
                        my robotics coach made for me, which ended up having just about the right words I would like. The picture is just there
                        because I thought it was cool!

                <div id = "Portfolio" class = "content-section">

                        The Portfolio page took the most time. I dedicated dozens of hours to making sure it looks
                        beautiful while retaining its function of easily being able to browse through all the different projects.
                        <br><br>
                        Each Project is composed of a title, a summary, importance, a date, a type, and a few tags to enable easy browsing.
                        The components of each project are stored in arrays that just contain strings equal to the values.
                        When the website is loaded, all the arrays are read and put into portfolioItem objects, which
                        then have a html skeleton made for them, which is edited based on screen size and device type.
                        Then each container is labeled and sorted as a small or large item based on its importance. A bar at the top
                        ties it all together. The bar contains button specific to the most popular tags that are derived automatically
                        on load time. Certain tags are color coded to make it easier to identify certain projects, and just overall
                        to make the website look cooler!
