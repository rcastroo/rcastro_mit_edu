                        This project was done in order to experiment with the <a href="https://gitlab.cba.mit.edu/jakeread/atkbreadboardboard">
                        Automotakit  breadboard board </a> which is based on the ATMEGA256A3U chip. The use of a DAC, ADC
                        , low pass filter, PWM, basic I/O, current control, clock setup, and interrupts on an Atmega chip are
                        some of the topics explored here.
                        <br><br>
                        In order to experiment around, the datasheet and manual were used extensively along with a scope
                        to mess around with values. Many lessons were learned through this project most heavily including the
                        use of registers.

                            Used to convert Analog signals to digital signals for processing. (i.e. - current sensing)
                            ADC can be setup in multiple ways- first divide being between single or differential mode
                            In the example, it is setup in differential mode W gain.

                            <li><strong>Timer & PWM</strong></li>
                            PWM(Timer, Prescalar, pwm channel, base frequency, desired frequency)<br>
                            For PWM, you have to setup multiple things. You are using the Timer on the chip,
                            so you have to setup its period(compare capture value with MAX 65536), its prescalar,
                            its mode, along with the channel at which to output when the timer hits the compare value.
                            Necessary Registers to run minimal PWM
                            <br>
                            Timer<br>
                            <br>
                            CTRLA - prescalar - use the minimum amount in order to preserve as much
                            resolution as possible<br>
                            CTRLB - Timer mode (Singleslope for PWM-> TC_WGMODE_SINGLESLOPE_gc)
                            and the pwm channel on which to output given as TCX_CCXEN_bm type<br>
                            PERBUFL & PERBUFH - Hi and lo period values for timer. Timer counts up to
                            this value and then restarts back to 0.<br>
                            <br>
                            Timer Channel<br>
                            <br>
                            CCXBUFH & CCXBUFL - compare value. When the Timer hits this value on its
                            count up, it will change the output to low.<br>
                            Timer Interrupts<br>
                            Also uses Timer (should be obvious given by name ;) )<br>
                            To set up, make sure that interrupts are enabled by including avr/interrupt.h,
                            and calling sei(); and setting the PMIC CTRL pins to each level wanted
                            (high, medium, and/or low level interrupts)<br>
                            Remember to set the pin you want as an output using PORTX.DIRSET register<br>
                            <br>
                            Timer<br>
                            <br>
                            CTRLA - setup prescalar<br>
                            PERBUFL & PERBUFH - setup period same as PWM above<br>
                            INTCTRLA - initiate the interrupt<br>
                            <br>
                            then, add a method without return type(not even void) named ISR(TCCX_OVF_vect),
                            where X is your timer number with the contents that you want to loop over.

                            Setup mininum and maximum outputs, with integral portion not allowed to go over
                            the MAX& MIN Outs. Since the derivative portion can be quite noisy run at a very
                            fast frequency, a low pass filter is automatically applied to the D value,
                            with K being a constant used to change the low pass filter's response time. See
                            low pass filter for details on that. dt is the period of each loop.(1second /frequency)
