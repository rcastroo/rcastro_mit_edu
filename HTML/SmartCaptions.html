                        We sought to create a better way to get fast and easy access to information about the topics of
                        discussion in an audio or video file. This would allow people to quickly read articles about
                        topics mentioned in debate or the news so that they can develop a better understanding of these
                        issues rather than just take someone's word for it.

                        First, our web-app takes an uploaded audio file and converts the speech to text using the Rev.com API.
                        Then natural language processing is applied to pull out the important ideas and topics
                        covered in the conversation. These keywords can then quickly be clicked to pull articles about them.

                    <div class = "content-section-content">
                        We developed both client- and server-side software to process audio files and pull out the main conversation
                        points. The client-side was developed primarily with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The server side was developed
                        using Python. The server is responsible for API calls to the Speech-to-Text service and the NLP. Communication
                        between the server and client is done through the use of Flask on Python. Flask allows the client to make REST
                        API calls that we developed to the server to initialize STT and NLP processing. This same REST API is used to
                        retrieve the data on the client-side and post the results to the client-side.
                        Our web-app takes advantage of Rev.com's Speech-To-Text processing and Google Cloud's Natural Language Processing to effectively process data. Flask is used to create a Python microserver that is accessed by the client using REST API calls.

                        At first, we found it difficult to approach the start of implementation. We tackled this problem
                        by speaking with the available developers that worked at the companies who hosted the APIs we
                        were using. By talking with the experts, we were able to make a clear diagram of what we wanted
                        and a path as to how we were going to implement that.

                        Our team is proud of how effectively we were able to go through the ideation process and to our
                        idea into a well-implemented web-app. Each one of our teammates learned about a new area of
                        programming and development that they had never explored before.
                        In terms of developing the back-end, we are very proud of the Python microserver that we were
                        able to develop. Nobody on our team had any experience developing a back-end coming into the
                        hackathon, but we made a very strong and effective back-end server that made 3rd-party API calls
                        and also was capable of handling REST API calls from the client to initialize these 3rd-party calls
                        and transfer information gathered by them.

                        This was the first hackathon for everyone on our team. We all learned how to contribute to a
                        group development project. We were able to effectively divide work loads while still allowing
                        for seamless integration between different people's code. We also learned in depth about how APIs
                        and servers work, giving us insight into back-end development that we never had. Overall,
                        we enjoyed learning how to take something from concept stage to basic implementation.
