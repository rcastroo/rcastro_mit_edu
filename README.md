Quick-time
handwritten html for each portfolio item - should not take too long, as all it requires is uploading images and its descriptions after copy pasting the few lines of html code, then having javascript running over it all in order to accomodate different screen sizes, and selection of project type- CAD, webdev, etc.

Long-term
Automatically generating portfolio items based off of a custom file type, along with ^^
